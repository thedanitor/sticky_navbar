# Sticky Navbar

https://thedanitor.github.io/sticky_navbar/

This project is from the Day 25 code along video from Udemy's 50 projects in 50 days series focused on web development. I have added some comments to the CSS and JavaScript to make notes to myself why certain choices are being made and what particular lines of code do.

### Overall Impression

Great to see how simple it is to make a good-looking home page. I have always used CSS frameworks for things like navbars, but I now that I see how easy it is I can confindently make one on my own.

### Things Learned

All of the techniques used for this project have been used in past projects, but it was very helpful to see them applied to this project.

Refresher:
* Can use ::before to create an overlay instead of making a new element
